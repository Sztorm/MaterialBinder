## Description

**MaterialBinder** is a scriptable object which takes references of shaders given by user to 
generate material binding scripts that limit work needed to use the material with specified
shader in scripts. Generated material binding types are easy to use and saves user from typing 
shader variable names, thus reducing possible errors.
